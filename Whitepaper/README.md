# Abstract

Shoe flipping is a profitable business [^1][^2][^3]. The Sneaky coin will act as a digital token that allows individuals and organisations to exchange value backed by rare physical sneaker collections. 

The tokens will operate as part of a secure blockchain ledger that tracks and audits the sneaker stock. The token will be backed by the sneakers and pegged loosely to the collection's value. This electronic tokenisation will allow the fractional ownership of expensive shoe collections on the open market.

SneakX will be the platform that will launch the crowd sale. SneakX has published a roadmap below that indicates that each shoe pair will eventually exist as a unique NFT token that can be purchased with Sneaky coins for storing inventory or personal, physical delivery.
