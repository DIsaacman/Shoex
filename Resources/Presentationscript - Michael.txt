ShoeX will act as a platform with accessibility and liquidity,
to provide solutions for both investors looking for diversification and sneakerheads hunting for their rare sneakers. 
How would this relate to Fintech? In this project, most of what we learnt were used to build the app. From Data Analysis and Machine Learning,
to blockchain for creating Crowdsale and Shoes NFT.

Let's dive into our approach to understand the flow.

First, we have the users. They can access and interact with ShoeX website to purchase SNEAKY COIN in presale, crowdsale. The website (which built by Stremlit),
provides the users neccessary info related to sales events, collect users name and email address and their requests. These requests will then be
processed and executed by the smartcontracts we built in the back-end. 


Then what do we do with the ML? The ML learning uses data collected from around 13,000 sales, then predict if a particular pair of shoes would be profitable
to purchase for resale. ML models we used are Logistic Regression, KNN. That's how we build up inventory. Then we come to the physical warehouse.
It stores the shoes and deliver the orders to customers. With this, we would use simple inventory management system.






CHALLENGES
Frontend and Backend integration was much more complicated than we expected. As Streamlit was relatively restrictive, we had to modify the works
many times for better integration. For example, initially we wanted to use a cloud service called DETA to build users information database.
But connecting this cloud service to streamlit proves to be a technical challenge. So eventually, we had to use CSV as a method of storage.
We think it is better to use HTML, CSS or JavaScript to build
the frontend.
