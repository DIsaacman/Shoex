## Project Overview - Tokenising High-End Sneakers

Shoe flipping is a profitable business. The Sneaky coin will act as a digital token that allows individuals and organisations to exchange value backed by rare physical sneaker collections. 

The tokens will operate as part of a secure blockchain ledger that tracks and audits the sneaker stock. The token will be backed by the sneakers and pegged loosely to the collection's value. This electronic tokenisation will allow the fractional ownership of expensive shoe collections on the open market.



### Introduction - Sneaky Coin

Blockchains and Distributed Ledger Technology have proven to be successful at tokenising real-world assets. 

We can now take previously indivisible assets and fractionalize the network's stake.

Assets such as Real Estate and Gold have been successfully tokenised using blockchain technology . The digitisation of the assets using smart-contracts significantly benefits the users. Moreover, the tokens are divisible into more affordable units with additional utility.

The User can now participate in the high-end sneaker game without spending time, money and effort to find, buy and then secure the physical sneakers.



## Detailed Usage - Buying Tokens

ShoeX will conduct a Pre-Sale to raise funds directly on the Ethereum blockchain as a Crowdsale smart contract in Solidity. In addition, ShoeX will sell digital ERC-20 tokens called Sneaky Coins to raise capital to invest in the sneaker collateral.

The benefit of the ERC-20 standard will be that tokens are immutable,  transparent, and tradable in a peer-to-peer fashion. The tokens can be self custodied and stored in a hardware wallet for safe keeping
