## Project Overview - Tokenising High-End Sneakers

Shoe flipping is a profitable business. The Sneaky coin will act as a digital token that allows individuals and organisations to exchange value backed by rare physical sneaker collections. 

The tokens will operate as part of a secure blockchain ledger that tracks and audits the sneaker stock. The token will be backed by the sneakers and pegged loosely to the collection's value. This electronic tokenisation will allow the fractional ownership of expensive shoe collections on the open market.

## Features

- **Tokenised Sneaker Ownership** ERC-20 Token on Ethereum Blockchain
- **Machine Learning Driven Algorithms** Data driven analysis for decision making using ML
- **Easy to Use Frontend** Interact directly with the blockchain with intuative User Interface

### Introduction - Sneaky Coin

Blockchains and Distributed Ledger Technology have proven to be successful at tokenising real-world assets. 

We can now take previously indivisible assets and fractionalize the network's stake.

Assets such as Real Estate and Gold have been successfully tokenised using blockchain technology . The digitisation of the assets using smart-contracts significantly benefits the users. Moreover, the tokens are divisible into more affordable units with additional utility.

The User can now participate in the high-end sneaker game without spending time, money and effort to find, buy and then secure the physical sneakers.

## Detailed Usage - Buying Tokens

ShoeX will conduct a Pre-Sale to raise funds directly on the Ethereum blockchain as a Crowdsale smart contract in Solidity. In addition, ShoeX will sell digital ERC-20 tokens called Sneaky Coins to raise capital to invest in the sneaker collateral. Pre-sale is open only to the selected investors who believes in ShoeX.

The public ICO offers investors with an option of withdrawing their funds incase goal is not met. ICO would be capped at investor level as well e.g. no investor can buy more than 100 tokens.

The benefit of the ERC-20 standard will be that tokens are immutable,  transparent, and tradable in a peer-to-peer fashion. The tokens can be self custodied and stored in a hardware wallet for safe keeping.

## User Instructions
### Back End deployment

To run the solidity code in Remix, please complie the solution files and follow the steps as in below gif for deployment of crowsale contracts.

### Back End - Crowsale workflow Demo
#### Stage 1 - Presale

Presale is open only for whitelisted investors, where tokens are offered at better rate. Gif belows describe buying tokens during presale

#### Stage 2 - Public ICO

Gif below describe buying tokens during public ICO

Gif below describe finalising post delivery refundable crowdsale when goal is not met. In this scenario investors can withdraw their money.

### Back End - Tokenisation

The ERC-20 was written in solidity, a smart-contract language on ethereum.

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.17;
```

Tools used were:

- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)  to access the ETH test-net

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) was leveraged to create, compile and deploy the ERC-20 token.

- [Open Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard) was used for the token contract templates.

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet for interacting with test net and signing transactions.


## Interacting with the Backend

In order to run the code on your local machine, please follow the below steps:

- Download the GitHub repo using ```git clone git@github.com:DIsaacman/Shoex.git```
- Open Remix IDE and upload the three ```.sol``` files in contracts folder
- Open Ganache and ensure metamask is installed and active
- Compile the Contracts in Remix-IDE
- Copy The ABI and save/overwrite to backend/contracts/compiled using the same names
- Deploy the ShoeX Token Presale and Crowdsale (ShoexTokenPreCrowdsaleDeployer)
- Parse in the input parameters including token name and token rate with Remix Deployer
- Copy the address owner of presale
- Copy the contract addresses
- Insert the addresses into an .env file using the sytnax

```env
MNEMONIC = "(insert 12 word keyphrase)"
WEB3_PROVIDER_URI= "http://127.0.0.1:7545"
PRE_SALE_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS= "(insert)"
PRE_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS= "(insert)"
SALE_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS= "(insert)"
SALE_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS= "(insert)"
```
- Launch AdminAp.py streamlit run ```adminApp.py```

## Analysis

### Data Analysis & Machine Learning

In order to ensure that the sneaker investments are profitable, we used ML and Data analysis to create models and guidlines for buying Sneakers. 

It is apparent that the best shoe sizes for a profitable return are between 9-11 as shown below.

![](Images/Research_size.png)

The Data was sources from StockX which is a collection of 10,000 shoe sales over a 3 year period.

Python version 3.7 and Sci-Kit-Learn (```sklearn```) were the main tools to create a KNN and Logistic regression model to determine if a shoe would meet a criteria of profitability.

<details>

```python
# Modules
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.ticker as plticker

# Import libararies for metrics
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from imblearn.metrics import classification_report_imbalanced
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report 
from sklearn import metrics

# Import Models
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
</details>

The code below created a profitability column based on if the profit of the shoe was at least 100%. The Bollean value was then converted into a binary integer which was used as a target in the Machine Learning model.

The data was trained tested and split before having several models applied. Oversampling the Data resulted in better accuracy scores to predict if the shoe would be profitable.

In the future, the model will be fitted with higher quality data as part of the ongoing improvement of the project.



```
#Set Profit Margin as a multiple
margin = 1

# Find Profitable Sales and Create New Column Called Profitable to act as a target
df['Profitable'] = (df['%']>= margin )

# Change bool value to integer
df['Profitable'] = df['Profitable'].astype(int)
```
